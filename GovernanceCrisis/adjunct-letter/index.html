This plan is overwhelmingly unpopular, if the results of a straw poll taken during a special College Council session on 9/21 are an indicator: only 1 of 107 anonymous respondents was in support.</p> <p>This plan completely removes <em>completely</em> adjunct representation in the governance process at CSI, both vote and voice. Currently 2 of the 54 faculty senate seats are reserved for adjunct faculty. Though this isn&#39;t a large percentage, it gives opportunity for significant voice.</p> <p>Peter Galati, one of the elected representatives, said at the town hall:</p> <blockquote> <p>You know I am unable to support this governance plan for the simple fact that adjuncts no longer have a voice. Adjuncts play a critical role in our college campus from classrooms to meeting with our students teaching our students, they play a critical role.</p> </blockquote> <p>&#40;cf. 52:52 of the <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/1479DUbQdB5rGOxFZgLRxPJktHpyFeSQrME9HdW1Hhm6awb7HKd4M6ik-b5tTKAj.XIS4fdtYP7V3oSJz?startTime&#61;1632248701000">recording</a>&#41;</p> <p>I echo Peter&#39;s words. The new plan not only disenfranchises adjunct faculty, but also the professional staff, the full-time faculty, and the students. Only administration gains vote and voice. In addition, the many committees tasked with the issues of college organization, institutional planning, and budget are simply abolished. An outside evaluation of the president&#39;s proposed plan by the guest speaker at the special session, Neal Hutchens, professor of Higher Education at the University of Mississippi, basically called it a TAKEOVER.</p> <p>I write asking you to do one simple thing: vote &quot;NO&quot; on a proposal that serves you no good.</p> <p>You will be receiving an email on 9/27 to your campus email from &quot;College of Staten Island, survey@csi.cuny.edu.&quot; This misleading &quot;survey&quot; masks the fact this is a binding referendum. Adjunct faculty are the largest voting body and this administration has done absolutely nothing to win your vote.</p> <p>Please open the email, go to the website, enter your EMPLID, and vote &quot;NO&quot; on the referendum</p> <p>We have been assured by the staff running the vote that: &quot;Just to clarify, the IR office will not know how individuals voted.&quot; So your important vote will be secret.</p> <p>If you wish to discuss this with someone, please reach out within your department to sound people out, or feel free to reach out to me at <code>jverzani@gmail.com</code>.</p> <p>Thanks for your attention, your time, your dedication to the college, and your &quot;NO&quot; vote.</p> <p>John Verzani Chair, College Council</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
