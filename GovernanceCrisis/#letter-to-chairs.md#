Dear Chairs, Program Coordinators, and others,

I write asking your help in circulating the following to any adjunct faculty working through your department. Thank you!


The President of the College of Staten Island is holding a referendum on a governance plan of his design between 9/27/2021 and 10/1/2021. This plan is overwhelmingly unpopular, if the results of a straw poll taken during a special College Council session are an indicator: only 1 of 107 anonymous respondents was in support.

This plan completely removes adjunct representation in the governance process at CSI, both vote and voice. Currently 2 of the 54 faculty senate seats are reserved for adjunct faculty. Though this isn't a large percentage, it gives opportunity for significant voice.

Peter Galati, one of the elected representatives, said at the town hall:


XXX insert here XXX

I echo Peter's words. The new plan not only disenfranchises adjunct faculty, but also the professional staff, the full-time faculty and the students. Only administration gains vote and voice. In addition, the many committees tasked with the issues of college organization, institutional planning, and budget are completely eliminated. An outside evaluation of the president's proposed plan by the guest speaker at the special session, Neal Hutchens, professor of Higher Education at the University of Mississippi, basically called it a "takeover."

I write asking you to do one simple thing: vote "NO" on a proposal that serves you no good.

You will be receiving an email to your campus email titled "College of Staten Island, survey@csi.cuny.edu." This misleading title hides the importance of this vote. Please open the email, go to the website, enter your EMPLID, and vote no. We have been assured by the staff running the vote that "Just to clarify, the IR office will not know how individuals voted." So your vote will be secret.

If you wish to discuss this with someone, please reach out within your department to sound people out, or feel free to reach out to me at `jverzani@gmail.com`.

Thanks for your attention and time,

John Verzani
Chair, College Council
