This is from Dept of Soc & Ant:


We reaffirm our opposition to the presidentâ€™s governance plan, both in its initial format and with the newly proposed changes. In addition we oppose the expanded adjunctification of CSI, which further undermines shared governance.We oppose both the content of the plan, which undermines faculty governance, and the autocratic process through which the administration attempted to impose it.
