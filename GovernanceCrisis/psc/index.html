Please see the announcement and invitation from College Council President John Verzani below.</p> <p>FYI, the CSI chapter Executive Council of the PSC totally rejects the proposed governance plan submitted for a vote by President Fritz. We strongly urge all the instructional staff to vote NO between September 27-Oct. 1. &quot;Instructional staff&quot; are defined in Article 6.1 of the CUNY Bylaws. This basically includes just about everyone employed at CSI. In short, the proposed governance plan is the response from President Fritz to the Vote of No Confidence last December 2020, and the new proposed governance plan greatly diminishes the voices, perspectives and experiences of staff and faculty in the governance of the college. There is nothing &quot;collegial&quot; in the president&#39;s plan. We need a strong NO vote because President Fritz will very likely take this vote to the CUNY Board of Trustees and seek their approval against our wishes. That is precisely why we need a strong NO vote on the proposed governance plan next week. We must stand in solidarity in the face of an administrative power grab that undermines, and violates, the spirit and content of our current CUNY Board-approved governance plan.</p> <p>george emilio sanchez chapter chair</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
