To be read for Professor Gerry Milligan

In my review of the governance plan it would seem that Honors would be even further relegated than it already is. We have no representation on curriculum or governance committees, despite the fact that we schedule and staff courses completely outside of departmental structures, and despite the fact that the program comprises nearly 500 students.  What little representation Honors currently has will be stripped away.


The deficiencies of this proposed plan, be they a result of oversight or intentional suppression, are substantial. Any changes to the governance plan, which is needed if Honors is to have its rightful place among decision makers, should take place through the established channels of the By-Laws committee.
