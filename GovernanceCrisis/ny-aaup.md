The Executive Committee of the New York State American Association of University Professors  (AAUP) is aware of the current struggle between the President of the College of Staten Island and the faculty.  As the state-wide body representing and promoting the principles and practices of shared governance of the AAUP, it is our duty to inform all relevant parties of the following:

The Governance Plan of Colleges and Universities delineates the responsibilities of faculty and administration and, as such, should be written by both parties.  It is not acceptable practice for the President of a college to write this document without significant faculty input and approval;

The proposed governance plans systematically eliminates several standing committees such as budget, bylaws, and institutional planning with the stated intent to replace these when deemed necessary with ad hoc committees selected by the president is counter to recommendations of the AAUP to ensure elected faculty representation for such activities.

Given the existing delineation of responsibilities, it is considered highly unusual and troubling that the president of the College of Staten Island has chosen not to involve any of the governance processes for the drafting of his wholesale governance replacement. The avoidance of existing committees comprised of elected members such as the By Laws Committee and the College Council, and the utilization of makeshift committees over the summer months with no reporting of their activity, runs counter to recent recommendations of the AAUP:

When faculty members opt to participate in a makeshift governance process, they should do so under the same conditions that govern their participation in the standing governance structure: they should be elected by the faculty rather than appointed by the administration, and they should be free to discuss the bodyâ€™s work with their colleagues and report regularly to them.

Most troubling are reports that the president has stated publicly several times that he may not respect the results of a college-wide referendum if it is unfavorable to him and may proceed against the existing governance plan to forward a failed referendum to the Board of Trustees. His stated rationale that governance plans are merely advisory to a president may not interfere with the ability of a president to unilaterally suggest sweeping governance changes to the board, runs counter to 50 years of college governance within CUNY and over 100 years of AAUP policies of college governance.
