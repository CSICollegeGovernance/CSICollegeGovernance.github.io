We were not at all sure if the Curriculum Committees could meet this month – but Katie, Catherine, Sarah and the members of all three curriculum committees not only managed to meet and vote, but to get it all done in time for this meeting. The Gen Ed Committee met just yesterday. </p> <p>On behalf of the Faculty Senate, I would like to ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPLAUD the incredible work of Veronica DiMeglio. Veronica organized the work of these three committees and put everything in order for Thursday. Thank you Veronica&#33;</p> <p>The format of the meeting Thursday will be similar to our meetings in 1P-119, only voting will be done one-line. All guidelines for voting on curricular items and other proposals will be explained at the beginning of the meeting and reviewed when we get to the curricular items – should members join us late.</p> <p>Naturally, we ask for your patience and good humor as we explore new ways of meeting, new uses of Zoom, and new lengths to our technological abilities&#33;&#33;</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing everyone on Thursday&#33;</p> <p>Sincerely, Deborah De Simone Secretary, Faculty Senate</p> <p>Topic: College Council and Faculty Senate Meeting Time: Apr 23, 2020 02:30 PM Eastern Time &#40;US and Canada&#41;</p> <p>Join Zoom Meeting https://zoom.us/j/99482410455?pwd&#61;b2xJUTFVQjE1cGVSZWE0bk1ZQmR6Zz09</p> <p>Meeting ID: 994 8241 0455 Password: 615107 One tap mobile &#43;16465588656,,99482410455# US &#40;New York&#41; &#43;13126266799,,99482410455# US &#40;Chicago&#41;</p> <p>Dial by your location &#43;1 646 558 8656 US &#40;New York&#41; &#43;1 312 626 6799 US &#40;Chicago&#41; &#43;1 301 715 8592 US &#43;1 346 248 7799 US &#40;Houston&#41; &#43;1 669 900 9128 US &#40;San Jose&#41; &#43;1 253 215 8782 US Meeting ID: 994 8241 0455 Find your local number: https://zoom.us/u/adhZY9XwbZ ​ </p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
