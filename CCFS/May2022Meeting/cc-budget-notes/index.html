This updates the mid-year report. The main news was an updated tuition revenue amount &#40;to -6.5M from -5.3M&#41;.</p> <p>The Federal Stimulus monies should amount to a 14.5M reimbursement to the college this year. This can cover revenue loss due to enrollment declines. We heard that the balance of stimulus funds – which must be exhausted by the end of the <em>next</em> fiscal year – should be sufficient to absorb a similar loss of revenue. However, a reminder that enrollment &#40;which fell 7.3&#37; in fall and 13&#37; in spring&#41; is <strong>very</strong> important.</p> <p>We reviewed the Senior College budget picture after the state budget was approved.</p> <p>There is much good news here:</p> <ul> <li><p>TAP GAP is closed earlier than planned</p> <li><p>New monies for faculty &#40;53M&#41; which positions the university to hire 500&#43; <strong>NEW</strong> faculty &#40;not supplanting faculty losses&#41;.</p> <li><p>Fringe benefits has 67M of new funding</p> <li><p>There is 40M in <em>one-time</em> funding to investment in projects within a certain scope</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
