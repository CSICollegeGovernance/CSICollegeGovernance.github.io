Topics of discussion included:</p> <h2 id=division_ii_athletics ><a href="#division_ii_athletics" class=header-anchor >Division II athletics</a></h2> <p>The committee received a long, detailed report on the new costs incurred by the transition to Division II sports by our interim Athletic Direct, TJ Tibbs. The report included 5-years of costs broken down by funding area. As well, a overview of additional funds generated by our student athletes was given.</p> <p>Highlights included a stated long-term goal of 1M in fundraising efforts and an announcement of record giving Tuesday amounts.</p> <h2 id=enrollment ><a href="#enrollment" class=header-anchor >Enrollment</a></h2> <p>We had asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>Enrollment. With the enrollment dashboard showing continuing students are down 15&#37; compared to this time last year enrollment is a concern for all. Can we discuss projections and planned actions related to enrollment?</p> </blockquote> <p>We heard of efforts including recruitment of athletes, outreach to adult learners, additional transfers from our Community College partners, especially KBCC.</p> <p>Currently returning student enrollment is off some 15&#37;, when queried where the bulk of the students were going &#40;other CUNY units, SUNY, other&#41; we learned that students stopping out is the largest reason given.</p> <p>Faculty help was volunteered with recruitment.</p> <p>Comments about the CUNY First registration process being confusing and reports of student isolation were shared.</p> <p>As there are 40M in discretionary funds within CUNY in this years budget, a question about how it could be spent to increase enrollment was asked. We learned AVP Scott has plans for a windfall &#40;should it come our way&#41;</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia. Last modified: May 16, 2022.
