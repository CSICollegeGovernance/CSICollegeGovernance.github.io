# Notes from the Budget Committee Meeting of May 9th


## 3rd Quarter report

The college recently submitted numbers for the 3rd quarter financial report (a CUNY document). This updates the mid-year report. The main news was an updated tuition revenue amount (to -6.5M from -5.3M).

The Federal Stimulus monies should amount to a 14.5M reimbursement to the college this year. This can cover revenue loss due to enrollment declines. We heard that the balance of stimulus funds -- which must be exhausted by the end of the *next* fiscal year -- should be sufficient to absorb a similar loss of revenue. However, a reminder that enrollment (which fell 7.3% in fall and 13% in spring) is **very** important.

We reviewed the Senior College budget picture after the  state budget was approved.

There is much good news here:

* TAP GAP is closed earlier than planned
* New monies for faculty (53M) which positions the university to hire 500+ **NEW** faculty (not supplanting faculty losses).
* Fringe benefits has 67M of new funding
* There is 40M in *one-time* funding to investment in projects within a certain scope
