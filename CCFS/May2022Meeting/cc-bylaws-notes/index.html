These are related to committee composition and term limits.</p> </ul> <p>We have sent requests for discussion to 6 committees seeking feedback on the suggested changes. The 3 curriculum committees did not discuss the changes. We will remind them to do so at their first meeting in the fall.</p> <p>We received feedback from the Budget committee and decided to pause on these suggestions and see if the past practice of HEO participation continues.</p> <p>We received feedback from the faculty facilities committee and need to canvas the College Council committee.</p> <p>We received positive feedback from the academic technology committee, but will now canvas the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and the ITAC committee.</p> <ul> <li><p>We discussed term limits at length. At the end of a robust conversation, it was felt that this part of the proposal from the HEO steering committee would not be included in our draft of proposed changes.</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
