# Notes from the May 11th Bylaws Committee Meeting

* We reviewed the notes from the prior meeting

* We reviewed the minor change to the draft document

* We are working through a collection of suggestions made by the HEO steering committee. These are related to committee composition and term limits.

We have sent requests for discussion to 6 committees seeking feedback on the suggested changes. The 3 curriculum committees did not discuss the changes. We will remind them to do so at their first meeting in the fall.

We received feedback from the Budget committee and decided to pause on these suggestions and see if the past practice of HEO participation continues.

We received feedback from the faculty facilities committee and need to canvas the College Council committee.

We received positive feedback from the academic technology committee, but will now canvas the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and the ITAC committee.

* We discussed term limits at length. At the end of a robust conversation, it was felt that this part of the proposal from the HEO steering committee would not be included in our draft of proposed changes.
