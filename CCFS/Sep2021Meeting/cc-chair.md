## Meeting with the President and Provost

On 9/16 the College Council Executive Committee met with the President and Provost

Topics under discussion were:

* The budget picture

The budget committee of the College Council had been informed of a draft financial plan for the next three years, as expected by central CUNY. At the time we heard that though federal funds would cover the college through the next 2 years, the 3rd year had a 5M projected deficit.

It was discussed at the meeting that some model assumptions about state support and enrollment were difficult to predict at this time.

The need to hire more faculty and staff was expressed.


* Campus reopening and facilities issues

We discussed campus re-opening and related issues. The aftermath of IDA left at least two buildings offline for awhile, likely the duration of the semester. This due to an accumulation of water in the basements that was unable to be immediately addressed. An earlier storm had toppled numerous trees. We heard that the campus did not expect to have any out-of-pocket expenses for any repairs.

We asked about campus leeway given CUNY recommendations.

* The proposed governance plan.

The College Council re-iterated its recommendation that this proposed referendum be dropped. It restated that the results of the referendum should be respected. There was a direct question as to whether that would be done. The response was not unequivocal, as it should be.

It was stated by the College Council Chair that the results will be overwhelmingly a "NO" and that the results will be embarrassing.

## Special Session of the College Council
