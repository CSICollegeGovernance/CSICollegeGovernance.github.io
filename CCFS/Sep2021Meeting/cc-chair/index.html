At the time we heard that though federal funds would cover the college through the next 2 years, the 3rd year had a 5M projected deficit.</p> <p>It was discussed at the meeting that some model assumptions about state support and enrollment were difficult to predict at this time.</p> <p>The need to hire more faculty and staff was expressed.</p> <ul> <li><p>Campus reopening and facilities issues</p> </ul> <p>We discussed campus re-opening and related issues. The aftermath of IDA left at least two buildings offline for awhile, likely the duration of the semester. This due to an accumulation of water in the basements that was unable to be immediately addressed. An earlier storm had toppled numerous trees. We heard that the campus did not expect to have any out-of-pocket expenses for any repairs.</p> <p>We asked about campus leeway given CUNY recommendations.</p> <ul> <li><p>The proposed governance plan.</p> </ul> <p>The College Council re-iterated its recommendation that this proposed referendum be dropped. It restated that the results of the referendum should be respected. There was a direct question as to whether that would be done. The response was not unequivocal, as it should be.</p> <p>It was stated by the College Council Chair that the results will be overwhelmingly a &quot;NO&quot; and that the results will be embarrassing.</p> <h2 id=special_session_of_the_college_council ><a href="#special_session_of_the_college_council" class=header-anchor >Special Session of the College Council</a></h2> <p>On 9/21, at the request of more than 20&#37; of the College Council members, a special session of the College Council was held on the matter of the referendum on the proposed governance plan</p> <ul> <li><p>There were 281 different people who attended this special session.</p> <li><p>The Chair of the College Council spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>The Chair of the Faculty Senate spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>The Chair of the Professional Staff Congress &#40;PSC&#41; spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>The Co-chairs of the HEO steering committee spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>The Student Government President spoke out in opposition; the outgoing Student Government Presidnet made a statement in opposition</p> <li><p>The adjunct representative to the Faculty Senate spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>Numerous members of the college community spoke out in opposition</p> <li><p>An independent reading of the plan by a professor of Higher Education at the University of Mississippi and a member of the AAUP Litigation Committee characterized the plan as a <strong>takeover</strong></p> <li><p>There were <strong>0</strong> people speaking in favor; there are <strong>9</strong> administrative positions reserved for the College Council</p> </ul> <p>A straw poll was taken at the end of the meeting.
