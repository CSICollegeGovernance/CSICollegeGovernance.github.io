The idea was enforcing a vaccine mandate and <em>also</em> assigning modalities of instruction means departments and programs can&#39;t necessarily tune their offerings to student demand, resulting in lost enrollment.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>We would like to discuss new enrollment strategies and their anticipated impact.
