We are about halfway through the semester, and I’m happy to say that the future looks bright. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be subsiding, albeit slowly, and we are gradually seeing a return to “normal” life. It’s important to recognize the herculean efforts of CSI’s faculty and staff throughout this crisis, and to honor the lives of those who have suffered or are no longer with us.</p> <p>The Executive Committee was heartened by the results of the recent referendum on the president’s proposed governance plan, in which 87&#37; of the instructional staff voted no. We are urging the president to withdraw the plan and to work in a collegial manner within the established institutional structure for reform, if there are changes that the college determines are needed. We will most certainly join with the entire CSI community to continue to improve our college governance structures, and we appreciate the anticipated participation of our hundreds of colleagues who all want what’s best for the College.</p> <p>On October 12, the Executive Committee met with the Provost, the Deans and the Associate Provosts. The Provost reported that over 90&#37; of students taking in-person classes are now vaccinated, and that the numbers in hybrid courses is also rapidly increasing. At the time of that meeting, no students had been given the WA grade, and there is optimism that the number of students affected by the vaccine mandate will be relatively small. We do not know exactly what that number will be. Given the Resolution on Instructional Modality that was introduced at the last Senate meeting, we asked if students had been surveyed as to their preferences about taking on-line or in-person classes. The provost responded that such a survey had not been administered. We urge the administration to poll students and faculty as to their preferences so that departments can rely on data rather than anecdotal evidence. These preferences will clearly vary from department to department, and we expect decisions regarding teaching modalities to take place in consultation among the faculty, department chairs and the deans. Last month’s proposed resolution that was tabled will be sent to the Senate’s Academic Freedom committee for review.</p> <p>We were pleased to meet Interim Associate Provost Dante Tawfeeq at the meeting. We stressed to him the dire need of faculty across campus for support for their research. We asked that, at a minimum, funds for faculty travel be reinstated. We look forward to working with Dr. Tawfeeq in the coming months in resolving faculty needs in this area.</p> <p>The Faculty Senate Executive Committee has learned that faculty who were promoted this year did not receive an anticipated salary step increase, and that the decision was made at CSI – it did not come from CUNY. We have also just learned that search committees were formed for the positions of Interim Deans of the Schools of Health Sciences and Education, and that no faculty were included in those committees. We continue to assert that these schools need fulltime faculty members, not interim deans. We are dismayed by the administration’s continued practice of excluding faculty in decision-making and disregarding collegial practices of shared governance.</p> <p>In closing, we wish the Senate members a productive, joyful and fruitful fall. We are, as always, proud of our faculty, staff and students. We encourage you to contact us with any concerns or issues you’d like to see addressed by this body. We are here for you, and we are grateful for your support.</p> <p>Respectfully submitted,</p> <p>Jane Marcus-Delgado</p> <p>Chair</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
