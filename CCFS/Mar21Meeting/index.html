It is a document in which many proposed changes remain underdeveloped and it fails to detail how they would be implemented; it was created without due process of consultation with faculty and other stakeholders such as the standing By-Laws Committee and without the democratic process of approval by a majority of instructional staff; it diminishes faculty leadership; its abrupt and short timeline provides little opportunity for productive response. Therefore, we reject the proposal issued by the Office of the President on March 3, 2021. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p>The <strong>Council of Chairs</strong> voted on this statement</p> </ul> <blockquote> <p>We, the Chairpersons of the academic departments of the College of Staten Island, meeting as the Council of Chairs, object to the process through which the governance proposal has been presented without thorough consultation. We have strong concerns about the diminishment of the faculty role in academic decisions. We recommend a revised timeline that allows for careful consideration of every aspect of this plan and input from an array of stakeholders.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><a href="/CCFS/Mar-SpecialMeeting/RC_Statement_to_Board_5-15-2021.pdf">The Research Committee</a></p> <li><p><a href="/CCFS/Mar-SpecialMeeting/bio-statement.pdf">The Department of Biology</a></p> <li><p><a href="/CCFS/Mar-SpecialMeeting/history.docx">The History Department</a></p> </ul> <p>&#91;I will continue to post more here as they come&#93;</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
