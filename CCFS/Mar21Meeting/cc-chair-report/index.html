In his email he cited:</p> <blockquote> <p>To that end, I am proposing a new and more refined governance plan. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The proposed plan provides opportunity for broad participation. It is intended to be flexible and dynamic, give voices to the unheard, and enable CSI to respond to rapidly changing internal and external opportunities and challenges. In addition, it promotes four key elements; trust, respect, collegiality and accountability. </p> </blockquote> <p>Within two days, a substantial number of individuals had requested a special session of the College Council.

As for reopening, we heard that </p> <ul> <li><p>the college has a plan for 25&#37; reopening in fall &#40;measured somehow&#41;; other CUNY units have different plans, as they have different circumstances; </p> <li><p>the impact of widepsread vaccination has not entered into the plans</p> <li><p>for faculty eager to return to their offices to get back to work, we are currently under the cap on persons per day, and so there is some room to entertain requests.</p> </ul> <p>The conversation then turned to the proposed wholesale replacement plan. The defense made by the president was similar what he has expressed elswhere. The many points raised by the College Council Executive Committee similar to those expressed elsewhere. Despite the stated desire to hear new voices through this new plan, there was no indication that familar voices were to be listened to.</p> <h2 id=march_11_2021 ><a href="#march_11_2021" class=header-anchor >March 11, 2021</a></h2> <p>The special session of the College Council was held from 2:30 - 4:15.</p> <p>There were 279 unique zoom participants.</p> <p>A link to the zoom meeting in whole has been shared.
