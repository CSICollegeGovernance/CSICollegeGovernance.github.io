Nonetheless, we have to meet our May 15 contractual obligations.</p> <p>I have been discussing with P&amp;B for a number of weeks that our scenarios might be even deeper than the 35&#37; so there has been some time for planning. My target is a 35&#37; reduction in the adjunct budget — not a direction of where those cuts take place. I trust that our academic administrators in consultation with the chairs will make the best decisions possible under the circumstances. The cost of instruction analyses that have been shared with the deans and chairs are designed for them to determine where instructional and staffing changes could be most strategic and cost-effective.</p> <p>I also note that the issuance of a non-reappointment letter does not prevent us from hiring back if we need to make adjustments.</p> <p>Bill</p> <blockquote> <p>On May 8, 2020, at 3:01 PM, Jane Marcus Delgado &lt;Jane.MarcusDelgado@csi.cuny.edu&gt; wrote:</p> <p>​​ Dear Bill,</p> <p>We learned today that without any clear process of deliberation and without any clearly stated principles the chairs were told to cut 35&#37; of their adjuncts across the board. While we recognize cost savings at this time of uncertainty are necessary, we also recognize that without a clear process and clear principles and priorities, such cuts will only be met with derision and the subsequent loss of morale. BCC &#40;https://csi-covid19.github.io/CUNY/5-6-bcc.pdf&#41; has demonstrated one way this can be done with community engagement. Clearly you need the help of the faculty and the college community to manage this crisis, and we ask again that you create a task force to vet the college&#39;s response to to the pending financial crisis. We recommend that this group include the budget committees of the P&amp;B.</p> <p>Regards,</p> <p>Jane</p> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
