Among the questions were:</p> <ul> <li><p>Are improved bathrooms in the request? AND: Yes, in the capital request are many pages of details</p> <li><p>Has SUNY finished its request, are they similar? ANS: SUNY was not know to have approved a request</p> <li><p>Can we discuss the Fund Allocation Model? ANS: CHancellor convened; comprised of some presidents and VPs of Finance; will include faculty <em>consultation</em> <strong>after</strong> decisions made; before anything is brought to the board.</p> <li><p>The request called for 1075 new lines, what is the actual needed number? There are 500 lecuturer lines, will they be distinguished lecture lines or regular or conversion? ANS: up to campuses</p> </ul> <h2 id=chairs_report ><a href="#chairs_report" class=header-anchor >Chair&#39;s report</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Omicron – monitoring the sitution</p> <li><p>Faculty vaccination – no change in policy &#40;despite recent city mandate for some employees&#41;</p> <li><p>Search committee has completed their work for EVC of advancement</p> <li><p>University Provost search has finalists</p> <li><p>Enrollment: the UFS is <em>not</em> receiving details on enrollment</p> <li><p>Modality: Resolutions from subcommittees are being drafted</p> </ul> <h2 id=bac_resolution ><a href="#bac_resolution" class=header-anchor >BAC Resolution</a></h2> <p>&#40;Attached&#41; Passed unanimously. Many questions about the lecturer lines &#40;500 are planned&#41;.</p> <h2 id=suny_ufs ><a href="#suny_ufs" class=header-anchor >SUNY UFS</a></h2> <p>Two SUNY Faculty Governance leaders spoke on conditions at SUNY. There were many similarities &#40;enrollment at CCs also down continuing a long trend – 6&#37; down this year, 30&#37; down over time; university centers have uptick in enrollment;</p> <p>Lot of high level searches were ongoing.</p> <p>A report on the University Chancellor&#39;s precarious position &#40;he resigned recently&#41; due to inappropriate text messages.</p> <h1 id=faculty_governance_leaders_meeting_report ><a href="#faculty_governance_leaders_meeting_report" class=header-anchor >Faculty Governance Leaders Meeting Report</a></h1> <p>The Faculty Governance Leaders met December 10.</p> <h2 id=the_interim_university_provosts_3070_rule ><a href="#the_interim_university_provosts_3070_rule" class=header-anchor >The Interim University Provost&#39;s 30/70 rule</a></h2> <p>A discussion about the infamous Lemon&#39;s memo of early September laying out a requirement for 70&#37; of classes to be held in person ensued. Several campuses relayed their feelings:</p> <ul> <li><p>the CCs by and large noticed that <em>online</em> classes were filling; <em>in-person</em> classes not filling &#40;QCC, BMCC, BCC&#41;. There were <em>serious</em> concerns expressed about enrollment. &#40;Last year CC enrollment dropped 14&#37;&#33; This Fall was another severe drop.&#41;</p> <li><p>QCC representatives called this a dramatic process violation &#40;a mandate on modality&#41; reminding everyone of the historical understanding that these decisions are the prerogative of the department chairs. The QCC representative is also involved with a resolution moving through UFS subcommittees &#40;Academic Affairs and Academic Freedom&#41;</p> <li><p>York interpreted the 70&#37; as based on past practice, so has some 50&#37; in person.</p> <li><p>LGCC met mandate with much grumbling.</p> <li><p>Lehman had reservations about the process and implementation &#40;they still have many closed buildings&#41;</p> <li><p>Hunter&#39;s Faculty Senate has passed a document on modes of instruction and the Hunter representative spoke highly of the practice at UC Berkeley.</p> <li><p>The Journalism Schools will be almost exclusively <em>in-person</em></p> <li><p>The UFS FGLs will vote on a resolution at its first meeting in the spring. The temporary authorities granted the Chancellory by governor Cuomo has long since passed and the universal sentiment is that a return to the regular order is due.</p> </ul> <h2 id=bac_budget_resolution ><a href="#bac_budget_resolution" class=header-anchor >BAC Budget resolution</a></h2> <p>A resolution in support of the CUNY and SUNY budget requests was discussed. It had already passed the UFS. Some plans to have faculty lobby were made.</p> <h2 id=cuny_fund_allocation_model_working_group ><a href="#cuny_fund_allocation_model_working_group" class=header-anchor >CUNY Fund Allocation Model working group</a></h2> <p>Ned Benton, UFS Budget Advisory Committee Chair, discussed a Fund Allocation Model working group to review the allocation model for the campuses. This group has no faculty representation. It was suggested that such representation be sought. &#40;The CUNY Budget model is <em>primarily</em> a roll-over budget; this group may significantly shake this up.&#41;</p> <h2 id=new_uniform_grading_policy ><a href="#new_uniform_grading_policy" class=header-anchor >New Uniform Grading Policy</a></h2> <p>Some campuses expressed concern that newly announced <em>uniform</em> grading policies were in conflict with their governance approved grading policies.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Septimia Zenobia.
