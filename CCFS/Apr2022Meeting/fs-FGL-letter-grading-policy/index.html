Subject: The May <span class=hljs-number >22</span>, <span class=hljs-number >2021</span>, Policy &amp; Procedure Memorandum from the University Registrar
(https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/<span class=hljs-number >4</span>/page-assets/about/administration/offices/registrar/resources/CUNY-Uniform-Grade-Glossary-Policies-and-Guidelines-<span class=hljs-number >05222021</span>-<span class=hljs-number >1.</span>pdf)

We the undersigned CUNY Faculty Governance Leaders have respect <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> and honor the shared governance processes as established by the CUNY Board of Trustees and so write to you to express our concern that the issuance of the May <span class=hljs-number >22</span>, <span class=hljs-number >2021</span>, memorandum above did not conform to those processes. In that memorandum, without corresponding prior action by the CUNY Board of Trustees, the University Registrar stipulates <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> regard to policy changes noted below that “This Policy shall supersede and override all undergraduate and graduate program-level grading change policies currently <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> effect at CUNY colleges and schools” (see pp<span class=hljs-number >.9</span>-<span class=hljs-number >10</span>). The policies below concern aspects of the faculty’s primary responsibility <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> determining whether students have met academic standards meriting a certain grade or their continued enrollment at the college. The CUNY Bylaws assign these responsibilities to a college’s faculty <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> Article <span class=hljs-number >8.5</span> and assign policy-making power on these issues to a college’s academic governing body such as a Faculty/Academic Council <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> Article <span class=hljs-number >8.6</span>. Further, <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> the resolutions cited <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> <span class=hljs-number >2.08</span> Governance of the University <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> the CUNY Manual of General Policy, the Board also gives campuses autonomy on these issues through its charge that campuses design their own governance plans, subject to its approval. Consistent with our acknowledging the Board and its Bylaws, policies, and processes, we thus respectfully ask that the appropriate authorities <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> the Chancellery take the following actions with regard to three areas below from the above memorandum:

<span class=hljs-number >1.</span> On Grade Appeals:
A. Retract the Student Appeal and Grade Appeals Process sections on pp. <span class=hljs-number >8</span>-<span class=hljs-number >9.</span> In particular, retract:
i) The timing restrictions on p<span class=hljs-number >.8</span>: “Appeals must be filed [by the student] within <span class=hljs-number >30</span> calendar days of grade assignment <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> CUNYFirst” and the subsequent stages are to follow <span class=hljs-number >30</span> days after.
Rationale: The <span class=hljs-number >30</span>-day deadlines would start and/or expire within the January <span class=hljs-keyword >break</span> and the summer annual leave period.

            ii) That the ruling of the department or college grade appeals committees be only a recommendation to the faculty member, who <span class=hljs-number >15</span> days upon the receipt of the recommendation is to inform the Registrar of their “decision to either sustain the grade or submit a grade change.”
            Rationale: Making the decision on the appeal only a recommendation to the instructor is inconsistent with a substantive student grade appeal process: it would render the appeal process without force and give students no real recourse from what they see to be faulty decision-making by their instructor. The proposed policy is also inconsistent with powers given to department or college bodies <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> some campus Governance Charters.

B. Honor the decisions made by campuses <span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> their own approved grade appeal processes.
<span class=hljs-number >2.</span> On FIN grades:
A. Retract on p<span class=hljs-number >.8</span>: “An appeal instituted by a member of the faculty to change an administrative FIN must indicate that the work required to resolve the INC grade was <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> the instructor’s possession prior to the INC deadline date.”
            Rationale: This nullifies long-standing policies on some campuses that allow faculty to permit a student to turn <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> work after the INC deadline. There the opportunity <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> such extensions has benefitted many students over the years.

B. Honor the extensions granted to students beyond the INC deadline, <span class=hljs-keyword >if</span> they are given by faculty according to policy approved by the campus policy-making body on academic matters.

<span class=hljs-number >3.</span> On the removal of the <span class=hljs-number >0.00</span> quality points from the WU (Withdrew Unofficially) so that receipt of a WU does not affect a student’s GPA:
We recognize that this change may be merited given the fact that there are often cases <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> which students <span class=hljs-keyword >end</span> up with a WU and the application of <span class=hljs-number >0.0</span> quality points to their GPA may be unfairly punitive. But a campus faculty/academic governance body may legitimately decide that regular, repeated receipt of WUs by a student is not consistent with their being <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> good academic standing on that campus. Thus, colleges should be able to limit the times a student may receive a WU without effect on standing.
            Thus, either allow campuses to add policies on how the number of WUs will affect student standing or, <span class=hljs-keyword >if</span> there will be a CUNY-wide policy, go through the proper academic policy-making process of consultation with campuses and approval of a policy by the CUNY Board of Trustees.

In sum, our view is that unless the Board of Trustees has decided or will decide that there will be one universal grade appeal process at CUNY, or that a campus faculty cannot provide <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> a process of granting extensions <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> students to make up incomplete work prior to graduation, then the relevant existing campus-approved policies stand. Further, we think that the removal of the effect of an unofficial withdrawal on a student’s GPA should be approved by the Board of Trustees and issued along with guidance on how campuses may factor the receipt of WUs into decisions about student standing.
